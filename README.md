### Introduction
Share-a-House is a full-stack application. It matches a user seeking housing with a resident of a house seeking housemates. Compatibility is determined by comparing a user's answers to a questionnaire with the answers from householders. The closer the answers are, the more likely they will be happy living in the same house.

### Demo

Share-a-House uses Node and Express servers for functionality and data handling. Heroku hosts the application.
